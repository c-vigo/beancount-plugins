Generalizing Long/Short:
------------------------

- philosophy: no config or tags required, validate changes, warn and don't touch
  ambiguous situations

- limit to a single matching income posting per entry, else impossible
  - what if i want to use only loss/gain functionality without this? present as two
    different plugins?

  - collapse multiple income postings to a single one first? is this a valid thing to
    do?

  - confirm that the weight of all assets held at cost minus all cash postings is equal
    to income posting
